  Method Overloading:- Same class , same method with different argument.
  Method Override   :- Different class with same methodname. It's should be an inherited class.

3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
a.Interface is a design also an unimplemented method. The only accessable access modifiers are "Public and Default". We can't use object

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
a.Multiple inheritance is a type, where a class inherits from more than one base class.
  Multilevel inheritance that inherits from derived class, making that derived class a base class for a new class.

6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
a.No

7.What is keyword for using inheritance
a.Extends 
 
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
a.Implements

9.what is difference between class and interface
a.A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object.
  An interface contains behaviorrs that a class implements.

10.what is difference between class and abstract class
